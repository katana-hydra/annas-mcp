## Requirements

If you plan to use only the CLI tool, you need:

- [A donation to Anna's Archive](https://annas-archive.li/donate), which grants JSON API access
- [An API key](https://annas-archive.li/faq#api)

If using the project as an MCP server, you also need an MCP client, such as [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download).

The environment should contain two variables:

- `ANNAS_SECRET_KEY`: The Anna's Archive API key.
- `ANNAS_DOWNLOAD_PATH`: The path where the documents should be downloaded.

Optionally, you can set:

- `ANNAS_BASE_URL`: The base URL of the Anna's Archive mirror to use (defaults to `annas-archive.li`).

These variables can also be stored in an `.env` file in the folder containing the binary.

## Setup

Download the appropriate binary from [the GitHub Releases section](https://github.com/iosifache/annas-mcp/releases).

If you plan to use the tool for its MCP server functionality, you need to integrate it into your MCP client. If you are using Claude Desktop, please consider the following example configuration:

```json
"anna-mcp": {
    "command": "/Users/iosifache/Downloads/annas-mcp",
    "args": ["mcp"],
    "env": {
        "ANNAS_SECRET_KEY": "feedfacecafebeef",
        "ANNAS_DOWNLOAD_PATH": "/Users/iosifache/Downloads"
    }
}
```

## Anna's Archive Mirrors

Anna's Archive has multiple mirrors, which may be innactive at times due to various reasons. Below is a list of known mirrors and their status as of January 2025:

| Mirror                                           | Type     | Status    |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------- | --------- |
| [`annas-archive.li`](https://annas-archive.li)   | Official | Active    |
| [`annas-archive.pm`](https://annas-archive.pm)   | Official | Active    |
| [`annas-archive.in`](https://annas-archive.in)   | Official | Active    |
| [`annas-archive.org`](https://annas-archive.org) | Official | Innactive |

Alternatively, use [The Shadow Library Uptime Monitor](https://open-slum.org) to find statuses or alternative mirrors.

This project defaults to `annas-archive.li`. If that mirror is not working for you, please set the `ANNAS_BASE_URL` environment variable to one of the other mirrors.
